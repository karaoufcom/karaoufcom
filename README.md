👋 Hi, I’m @karaoufcom

👀 I’m interested in legal tech, software that empowers people, 3D design, and the philosophical side of building things that matter.

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development, automation with AI agents, and exploring GPU/CUDA for future robotics applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful tech projects—especially those at the intersection of access to justice, storytelling, and automation.

📫 How to reach me: karaouf.com or Telegram (@karaouf) — I usually reply unless I'm deep in code or coffee.

⚡ Fun fact: I’m building my digital life like a Pixar short: a bit quirky, visually smooth, and just emotional enough to keep you watching.
